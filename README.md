# MADLayoutAssignmentPart1

### A. I do not change anything apart from the code itself. No changes on the asset folders and the pubspec.yaml file. Focus solely on my code.
### B. I created the layout using row and column widgets.
### C. Each raised button is clickable and every click or tap will toggle ON/OFF.
### D. ON/OFF toggles will change:
####    1) the text of the device status either from "ON" to "OFF" or vice versa
####    2) the icon shown from enabled icon to disabled icon and vice versa
####    3) the raised button colour from light to dark and vice versa
