# MADLayoutAssignmentPart1

### I created the layout using row and column widgets.
### Each raised button is clickable and every click or tap will toggle ON/OFF.
### ON/OFF toggles will change:
#### 1) the text about the device status either from "ON" to "OFF" and vice versa
#### 2) the icon from enabled icon to disabled icon and vice versa
#### 3) the raised button colour from light to dark and vice versa
