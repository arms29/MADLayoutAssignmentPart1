# MADLayoutAssignmentPart1

### A. I created the layout using row and column widgets.
### B. Each raised button is clickable and every click or tap will toggle ON/OFF.
### C. ON/OFF toggles will change:
####    1) the text of the device status either from "ON" to "OFF" or vice versa
####    2) the icon shown from enabled icon to disabled icon and vice versa
####    3) the raised button colour from light to dark and vice versa
### D. I do not change anything apart from the code itself. No changes on the asset folders and the pubspec.yaml file.
